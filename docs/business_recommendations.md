# Business Recommendations

## Principle
Recommendations are anchored to **observed historical performance**, specifically conditions measured during profitable (GOOD) days, rather than hypothetical targets.

## Recommendations
1. **Use BE TACoS as a daily guardrail**
   - Treat break-even TACoS as an operational threshold to prevent advertising from exceeding sustainable unit economics.
   - When daily TACoS rises above BE TACoS, prioritize control actions over scaling.

2. **Prioritize conditions associated with GOOD days**
   - Focus traffic sources, campaign setups, and timing patterns that historically produced higher conversion and stronger organic share.
   - The goal is not to increase spend, but to reproduce the performance regime that generated positive contribution.

3. **Use GOOD-day CVR and organic share as realistic benchmarks**
   - These values have already been achieved under real market conditions.
   - Benchmarking against observed performance provides achievable targets aligned with the current cost model.

4. **Avoid scaling during structurally weak conversion periods**
   - BAD-day behavior indicates that increasing spend during low-conversion regimes leads to value destruction, even if ad-attributed sales increase.
   - Scaling decisions should be gated by conversion efficiency and TACoS relative to BE TACoS.

## Expected Outcome
If the business can consistently operate under conditions similar to GOOD days, advertising becomes structurally sustainable under the current unit economics.
This enables scaling strategies that grow revenue without amplifying losses.
